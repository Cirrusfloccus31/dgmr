# Rainfall Nowcasting on France using DGMR model

This repository applies the Deep Generative Model of Rainfall (DGMR) developed by Google DeepMind to Meteo-France rainfall data. The goal of this project is to provide accurate short-term rainfall forecasts (nowcasting) on France.

## Features
- Short-term rainfall forecasting (up to 2 hours)
- Utilizes DGMR model for high accuracy
- Trained on Meteo-France rainfall data
- Provides visualizations for rainfall predictions
- Easy-to-use interface for generating forecasts

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meteofrance/dgmr
cd dgmr
```

### Install environment

With micromamba or conda:

```bash
micromamba create -f environment.yml
```

```bash
micromamba activate dgmr
```

### Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings:
```plaintext
METEO_FRANCE_API_KEY=your_meteo_france_api_key
```

### Download the pretrained model from Deepmind

TODO : add link

## Usage
To generate a rainfall nowcast, use the following command:
TODO
```bash
python  XXX
```

## Examples
Here are some example rainfall nowcasts generated by the model:

## Data Sources
This project uses rainfall data from the following source:
- [Meteo-France](https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/)

TODO : describe data

## Model Architecture
The DGMR model is a state-of-the-art generative model designed for weather nowcasting. It leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce high-resolution realistic rainfall forecasts.
